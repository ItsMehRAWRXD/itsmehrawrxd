# RawrZ Security Platform - Elevated Privileges Edition

## 🎉 **NEW STANDARD BASELINE - FULL ELEVATED PRIVILEGES**

This is the new standard baseline for the RawrZ Security Platform with comprehensive elevated privileges implementation. All engines now operate at maximum functionality with complete system access.

## ✅ **What's Included**

### **Complete Elevated Privileges System**
- **Windows Administrator Scripts**: `start-elevated.bat`, `start-elevated.ps1`
- **Docker Privileged Containers**: `Dockerfile.privileged`, `docker-compose.privileged.yml`
- **Deployment Scripts**: `deploy-privileged.sh`, `deploy-privileged.ps1`
- **Privilege Testing**: `test-elevated-privileges.js`

### **Maximum Engine Functionality**
- **Red Killer**: Full registry access, service control, file operations, process termination
- **AI Threat Detector**: Complete model training, feature extraction, threat analysis
- **Private Virus Scanner**: Full system scanning, registry analysis, memory scanning
- **Advanced Encryption**: Proper PE structure with 48KB+ encrypted executables
- **All Engines**: Maximum system integration and capabilities

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Windows (Recommended)**
```bash
# Right-click and "Run as administrator"
start-elevated.bat
```

### **PowerShell**
```powershell
# Run PowerShell as Administrator, then:
.\start-elevated.ps1
```

### **Docker Privileged**
```bash
# Windows PowerShell (as Administrator)
.\deploy-privileged.ps1

# Linux/macOS
sudo ./deploy-privileged.sh
```

## 🔧 **Verification**

Run the privilege test to verify full functionality:
```bash
node test-elevated-privileges.js
```

**Expected Output:**
```
🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED - Full privileges available!
